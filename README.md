Drowsy Driver Detection System using Machine Learning
Driver fatigue is a significant factor in many vehicle accidents. Because of the hazard that drowsiness presents on the road, methods need to be developed for counteracting its affects. 
The main aim of this is to develop a drowsiness detection system by monitoring the eyes; it is believed that the symptoms of driver fatigue can be detected early enough to avoid a car accident. 
Detection of fatigue involves the observation of eye movements and blink patterns. 
This project is focused on the analysis of face images particularly localization of the eyes, by which we can predict whether the driver is asleep or not using a suitable algorithm.
